Is it possible to send an event to javascript so that javascript can invoke the stream, instead of native code? So far I haven't had any luck accomplishing this. Look into doing this in WakeupPlugin.onReset.

Android notes:

The plugin listens for the android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED intent to reschedule the alarms when the device powers on.

Force Stopping the application will kill all alarms. The alarms will be reset the next time the app is launched (manually).
