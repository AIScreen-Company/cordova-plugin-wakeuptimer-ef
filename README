Is it possible to send an event to javascript so that javascript can invoke the stream, instead of native code?

Android notes:

Restarting device or Force Stopping the application will kill all alarms. Use android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED intent filter to set alarms upon startup. If app is Force Stopped, it will have to be manually restarted and alarms could be reset at startup.
